# BibleSentiment

Using NLTK, this project analyzes the sentiment of the Old Testament, book by book. As expected, [Songs of Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_Songs) received the most positive sentiment score, and [Lamentations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Lamentations) received the most negative sentiment score.
